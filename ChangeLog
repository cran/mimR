	   * Version 1.3.0 has been created with the following changes:

	   * Communication with MIM now based on the rcom package rather
	     than the RDCOMClient package which was used in previous
	     versions.

	   * display: A primitive facility for displaying the graphs has
	     been added. It is based on the Rgraphviz and graph packages.

	   * The simulate function has been removed as it was not
	     consistent with the simulate function from the stats package.

	   * The manual has been updated.
